            <h3>My name is Ralph Dulla. I am a Computer Science student and I am in my 2nd year
                I love learning about HTML and CSS as it activates my creativity as I can create what I want.

        <h2>Story of my life</h2>
        <p>I was born at a very young age, when I was in my mother's womb I was introduced to technology
            .It was very fascinnating to me and I would think time to time if what would happen if I get my hands
            on  the technology, would it change my perspective to the world? I muttered. But then I was born
            Technology was vast in this high-tech world, growing up made me realize that society revolves around
            technology so I made a vow to choose Computer Science and take its great heights to its maximum 
            potenital and change the world.
