                Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in 
                February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later 
                became wildly popular in the United States and around the world. 
             The series, originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of 
                handheld consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United States with 
                two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue. 
            </p>
            <p> In the games, players assume 
                the role of Pokémon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing 
                them to battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful 
                video game franchises in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.
